## 💡 Description

This project was built to explore practical LLM integration across a real-world full-stack application — combining AI prompt engineering with scalable backend design, modern frontend tooling, and cloud deployment.

The tools are designed to produce engaging, personality-driven outputs that remain appropriate, original, and aligned with user-selected tone — with safeguards in place to avoid repetition, crude content, or generic language.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Axios (hosted on Vercel)
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, OpenAI API, Pydantic, Docker
- **Infrastructure:** Docker Compose, AWS EC2, Nginx, HTTPS via Certbot
- **AI & LLM:** GPT-3.5-Turbo, Prompt Engineering, Tone Control, Output Filtering
